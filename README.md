## Description
This repository contains my code for the Unit 1 project in the Treehouse Techdegree curriculum. This project is a random quote generator which displays a random quote on the page. The page automatically refreshes with a new quote ten second intervals or when the "Show another quote" button is clicked. The page's background color automatically changes when the page is refreshed.
